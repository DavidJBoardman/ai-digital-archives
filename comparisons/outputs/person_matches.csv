Some of these associations are tentative. It appears certain that the estate was part-owned by David Bernard (d. 1805) and that one moiety passed to his son Charles Bernard of Frampton Lodge (d. c. 1826), and the other to David Bernard's widow and other children. It also appears that Charles Bernard of Jamaica, and Bristol, David's brother, might have been part-owner prior to his death in 1797, with part-ownership possibly continuing to his son Charles Bernard of St James (d. 1820) but the ownership by this side of the family does not appear in the compensation records.","Eden Estate, JM","LBS-PLA-EST-05777, LBS-PLA-EST-e3033",Evelyn Stuart Parker,920_PAR_II_catalogue,1763-1795,
